MAC Address Randomizer for Kali Linux

A powerful Python tool that automatically randomizes your network interface's MAC address at regular intervals, enhancing privacy and anonymity during security testing.

Key Features:
🔄 Automatic Rotation: Changes MAC address every minute (configurable)

🖥️ Multi-Interface Support: Works with eth0, wlan0, and other interfaces

🎲 Valid MAC Generation: Creates manufacturer-plausible addresses using common OUIs

📊 Comprehensive Logging: Detailed activity tracking in /var/log/

⚙️ Systemd Integration: Option to run as persistent background service

🛡️ NetworkManager Compatibility: Gracefully handles managed interfaces

Ideal For:
Penetration testers needing frequent MAC rotation

Privacy-conscious users on public networks

Red team operations requiring identity obfuscation

Network troubleshooting and testing

Quick Start:
bash
sudo python3 mac_randomizer.py -i wlan0
Includes:
✅ Full systemd service setup
✅ Install/uninstall scripts
✅ Detailed documentation
✅ Troubleshooting guide

Why This Stands Out:
Unlike simple MAC changers, this maintains continuous rotation

Carefully avoids blacklisted virtual MAC ranges

Verifies each change was successful

Clean, production-ready Python implementation
